This README file is for CA03: Decision Tree Algorithm

Data Source and Contents:

The dataset is obtained from the Census Bureau and represents salaries of people along with seven demographic variables. The following is a description of our dataset:
â€¢	Number of target classes: 2 ('>50K' and '<=50K') [ Labels: 1, 0 ]
â€¢	Number of attributes (Columns): 7
â€¢	Number of instances (Rows): 48,842

Data:

Find in CA03 Folder in zipped file.

Notes for reviewer:

Every section in the CA03 - Decision Tree Algorithm.ipynb is labeled exactly the same as the instructions PDF (Part1 - Part 10). The answers to the questions are in the PDF file in the CA03 folder and I also put them in my code for your convenience. Make sure you run everything in the order that it is shown. There are comments in the code to help explain what the code is doing. 

If you have any questions or something is not running properly on your end, please reach out to me on MS Teams! Happy Grading! :)
